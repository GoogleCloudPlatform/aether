  - Simple resource scope with file handle
  - Complex nested resource scopes
  - Resource leak detection
  - Cleanup order verification (LIFO)
  - Resource contract validation
  - Exception safety during cleanup

### 5. Pattern Library Tests (Phase 5)
- **Purpose**: Verify pattern discovery, composition, and code generation
- **Scope**: Pattern catalog, composition engine, verification, generation
- **Test Cases**:
  - Individual pattern verification
  - Pattern discovery by intent
  - Pattern composition (sequential, nested, parallel, pipeline)
  - Code generation from patterns
  - Pattern conflict resolution
  - Performance estimation accuracy

### 6. End-to-End LLM Workflow Tests
- **Purpose**: Simulate complete LLM code generation workflows
- **Scope**: Intent → Pattern Selection → Code Generation → Verification → Execution
- **Test Cases**:
  - Simple arithmetic operation generation
  - Complex data structure manipulation
  - File I/O with error handling
  - Multi-threaded computation
  - Database interaction patterns
  - Web API integration

### 7. Standard Library Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Verify standard library modules work correctly
- **Scope**: Network, file I/O, string operations, mathematical functions
- **Test Cases**:
  - HTTP client/server operations
  - File system operations
  - String manipulation and parsing
  - Mathematical computations
  - Memory management functions

### 8. Performance and Scalability Tests
- **Purpose**: Validate compiler performance and output efficiency
- **Scope**: Large codebases, compilation speed, generated code performance
- **Test Cases**:
  - Large multi-file project compilation
  - Incremental compilation correctness
  - Generated code performance benchmarks
  - Memory usage during compilation
  - Pattern library scalability

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing (existing)
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete compilation → execution cycles
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking and profiling
5. **Regression Tests**: Prevent feature regressions

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **SMT Solver Integration**: Z3 dependency might be complex
   - **Mitigation**: Mock SMT solver for basic tests, real solver for advanced
2. **Resource Timing**: Resource cleanup timing might be non-deterministic
   - **Mitigation**: Use deterministic test scenarios with predictable resource usage
3. **Pattern Complexity**: Complex pattern compositions might be hard to verify
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple patterns, gradually increase complexity
4. **Performance Variability**: Compilation performance might vary by platform
   - **Mitigation**: Use relative performance metrics, not absolute timings

### Continuous Integration
- All tests run on every commit
- Performance regression detection
- Cross-platform validation (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Memory leak detection with Valgrind
- Code coverage reporting

This comprehensive testing plan ensures that AetherScript's LLM-first features work correctly and reliably across all use cases.
